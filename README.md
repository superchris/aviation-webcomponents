This is a proof of concept app I built for an upcoming Cincy JS talk.

## Goals:

* Implement app using vanilla web components (no framework)
* Use an existing web component within the app
* Data down, actions up
  * data passed into components via attributes
  * components dispatch events
  * "Fluxish" pattern to coordidate

## To run:

* node server.js to run proxy to airport api
* use live-server or equiv to serve app
